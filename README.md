# word_cloud

The files here are a representation of how you can use Python to create cool 'Wordclouds' from aggregated text.

The credit of the wordcloud 'work' itself goes to: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud. I have harnessed this for learning purposes & also to create wordclouds from files that I have programmatically downloaded & cleaned.
